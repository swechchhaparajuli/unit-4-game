Harry Potter RPG game-- choosing between 7 levels, from year 1 to year 7
    year 1 is easy to win, with health points of the AI being way lower than that of the players
        only one player, ron harry or hermione can defeat all 3 opponents
        
    on year 2-3 

    year 4 -- you will lose as harry but win if you play hermione and ron first

    year 5 is a good mix -- if you play hermione first, you will lose. If you play ron first you will win. This is because of the defense points and how they increment by each win vs loss. 


    year 7 is impossible so far-- 
        

        if you win background image will change to quidditch cup winning scene
        if you lose background image will change into scene after dumbledore's death
